How to Encrypt and Decrypt using Python?

To encrypt and decrypt with Python, you need to create a program in which it will first ask you if you want to encrypt a message or decrypt it. Then the program should receive a message from the user.
If the user chooses to encrypt the message, the user’s message must be transformed into a secret code. But if the user chooses to decrypt the message, your program should be able to convert a secret code into a meaningful text.
For this task, you must write a program that rearranges the order of letters in user input so that it cannot be understood by anyone. This can be done by putting the letters in even and odd positions.

How to Create:

Now let’s see how to create a GUI application to encrypt and decrypt using Python. Here we need to write some code that uses an infinite loop that will keep asking the user if they want to encrypt or decrypt a message.

According to user input, we need to write an event program because the operation of the program depends on user input. Here we can use the dialogue box to get user input and the info box to show the encrypted and decrypted message to the user.
As stated before, I will be using an infinite loop, so the program will keep running until the user wants to encrypt and decrypt using Python. The program will end at the point where the user gives input other than “encrypt” and “decrypt”.
